# clean up various unpleasant issues in the disassembly
# generated by objdump.
# As an incidental benefit, we get rid of some trailing whitespace.
#
# more importantly, we convert a bunch of constants that are
# displayed in decimal to good old hex.

# We look for a # followed by a digit or - sign
# interestingly we never see #0x
